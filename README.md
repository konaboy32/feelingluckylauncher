# Feeling Lucky Launcher

Random ROM launcher for MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator).

The program chooses a random ROM, displays the ROM info and then launches the game in MAME.

A Java Runtime Environment is required to execute the program.  The launcher has been tested with Java SE Runtime Environment 7 although all recent versions should work.
